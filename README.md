Programming elements in the GO language
# <a name="content"></a>Content description
- Complete and extend the Rational structure in Examples / Rational.go to allow working with rational numbers.
- Verifying a Sudoku configuration using bit operations
- Probabilistic algorithms
  - Target problem -> approximation of pi
  - Buffon's needle problem -> pi's approximation 
- Implement a DataCalendar structure with which to calculate:
  - Number of days between two calendar dates
  - The time elapsed between two calendar dates calculated in years, months, weeks, days
  - Date +/- a specified number of days
- Interpolation with spline functions. Give n points in the plane by their coordinates: (x [i], y [i]) and m values z [i]. Determine the values of the spline function at points z [i], where the spline function is determined using the n given points.
- Linear regression. They are given n points in the plane by their coordinates: (x [i], y [i]). Determine the regression line that approximates the given points.
- Fick equation.
